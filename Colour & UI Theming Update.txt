Colour & UI Theming Update

Scope: Apply a darker, bolder “dark-luxe” theme using brand colours and monogram underlays. Keep typography (Noto Serif / DM Sans) as specified.

Palette & Ratios
	•	Primary: Ocean Blue #00487C
	•	Base: Crisp White #FFFFFF
	•	Text/Dark UI: Charcoal #1D1D1D
	•	Neutrals: Iron #4A4A4A, Regent Grey #7F8C8D
	•	Accent (micro only): Orange #F06434 (≤2% of any screen)
	•	Chrome ratio guideline: Ocean Blue 50–60%, Charcoal 25–30%, Iron 10–15%, Regent Grey 5–10%; white reserved for content surfaces.

Global
	•	Page canvas: Charcoal background.
	•	Content containers: White cards with 24–32px padding; 1px Iron border (or soft shadow).
	•	Dividers: 1px Regent Grey (or Iron→Charcoal subtle gradient).

Header & Footer
	•	Header: solid Ocean Blue; white logo/wordmark; single primary CTA styled per “Buttons.”
	•	Footer: solid Charcoal; headings white; links Regent Grey → white on hover; include the standard image-disclosure line in Regent Grey.

Hero & Underlays
	•	Hero background: Ocean Blue with oversized WS monogram rings at 4–7% opacity, scaled 1.8–2.2× viewport.
	•	Optional vertical gradient overlay (very light) for depth. Ensure WCAG AA contrast for headline/subhead.

Section Rhythm
	•	Alternate dark and light: dark (Ocean Blue or Charcoal) for process, CTAs, pricing bands; light (White) for longer copy, galleries, FAQs.

Cards & Tiles
	•	White surface, Iron 1px border; on hover: subtle lift + Orange 2px top rule.

Buttons & States
	•	Primary: Ocean Blue fill, white text; hover darken ~8–10%; focus ring Orange 2px outside.
	•	Secondary (on dark): ghost (white text + 1px white outline); hover to white fill + Charcoal text.
	•	Tertiary links: white/Regent Grey with underline on hover.

Forms (Pricing/Contact)
	•	On dark: Iron inputs, white labels, Regent Grey placeholders, Orange focus ring.
	•	On light: white inputs, Iron text, Ocean Blue focus ring.
	•	Keep label visibility and ARIA/error handling as per a11y.

Typography
	•	Headings (Noto Serif): white on dark; Charcoal on light.
	•	Body (DM Sans): Regent Grey on light; white on dark.

Imagery
	•	On dark sections, add thin Iron frame or soft inner shadow to “float” images; keep image tones restrained so Ocean Blue and white typography lead.

Mobile
	•	Sticky bottom bar: Ocean Blue background, white icons/text, active underline Orange.

Motion (subtle)
	•	Micro-interactions at 100–150ms; gentle parallax on monogram rings (<10px). No flashy effects.

Accessibility & QA
	•	All text vs background must meet WCAG AA (≥4.5:1).
	•	Orange only for focus lines/micro accents; never for body text blocks or large fills.
	•	No non-brand colours introduced.

Acceptance Checklist
	•	Header/footer colours applied; hero shows monogram rings (4–7% opacity) with AA contrast.
	•	Alternating dark/light sections implemented as described.
	•	Buttons render with correct hover/focus; Orange usage within micro-accent limits.
	•	Forms show correct focus rings and readable labels on dark and light.
	•	Sticky mobile bar present on ≤768px.
	•	No non-brand colours; Lighthouse/WAVE shows AA contrast passes.
