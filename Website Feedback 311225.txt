Winder&Stilhaus — Website Adjustments

Date: 31 December 2025

Purpose: Align the live Next.js build with brand guidelines, the original brief, and the hard rules from 22 Dec 2025. Each section lists precise outcomes and an acceptance summary. Placeholders are permitted for assets I supply later.

1) Branding Implementation (Global) — Priority: P0

Outcomes
	•	Header uses the official horizontal lockup (WS monogram + “Winder&Stilhaus” wordmark), respecting the clear-space/min-size rules from the brand pack.
	•	Full brand palette applied site-wide. Use Ocean Blue (RAL 5020; use the exact HEX from the brand pack), Crisp White, Charcoal for type; Regent Grey and Iron for subtle UI; Orange as a micro-accent only (<2%). Hover state = subtle darken of Ocean Blue.
	•	Typography: Noto Serif for headings (H1 Bold; H2 Semibold; H3+ Regular). DM Sans for body/UI (Regular; buttons/labels Medium). Base 16–18 px, 1.5–1.6 line height.
	•	Favicon set derived from the WS monogram.
	•	Monogram “ring” underlays on hero and key banners: 4–7% opacity, 1.5–2.5× viewport scale, subtle motion (very low amplitude, gentle easing). Maintain AA contrast.

Acceptance
	•	Header shows the lockup crisply at 1×/2×.
	•	Fonts render exactly as specified.
	•	Only brand colours are visible in UI components.
	•	Favicon present.
	•	Monogram rings add depth without harming readability (contrast passes WCAG AA).

	•	Single primary CTA in the header (top-right): “Book a consultation”.
	•	Hero secondary CTA “Start instant quote” smooth-scrolls to the on-page Pricing Guide block and moves keyboard focus to its heading.
	•	Mobile: hamburger menu with focus trap and correct ARIA; sticky mobile action bar (Call, WhatsApp, Book) appears on scroll.

Acceptance
	•	Exact nav order on desktop and in mobile menu.
