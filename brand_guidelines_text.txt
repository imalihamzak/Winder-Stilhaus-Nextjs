Ideal for backgrounds, negative space, and high-contrast typographic layouts. Charcoal: A structural tone used for body text, supportive typography, dark backgrounds and areas requiring depth or a premium presence. Regent Grey: A soft neutral for understated backgrounds, secondary panels, supporting layouts and subtle structure within compositions. Iron: A lighter neutral used for contemporary, minimal design elements. Works well in editorial layouts, UI components. Orange: A bold highlight applied sparingly to draw attention to calls-to-action, key markers or moments of emphasis. Note: Charcoal #1D1D1D only. Orange micro accent <2%, never run both brights together, and do not colour the logo with Orange. 3.0 Typography 3.1 Primary font — Noto Serif The Winder&Stilhaus logotype is set in Noto Serif, a refined typeface known for its clarity, balance, and timeless elegance.

Weights shown: Regular, Medium, Semi Bold, Bold. 3.2 Secondary font — DM Sans As a secondary typeface, DM Sans introduces a modern, minimalist edge to the Winder&Stilhaus identity.

AI CGI should be photorealistic and material-accurate, reflecting real-world finishes and RAL-true colour values. Lighting and shadows should mirror natural conditions, and scenes should remain realistic and buildable rather than conceptual or exaggerated. Rules Match real-world materials and finishes. Use accurate colour values. Keep lighting natural and believable. Avoid conceptual or fantasy scenes. 4.2 Imagery direction The Winder&Stilhaus visual language is rooted in modern architectural thinking and disciplined use of colour. Imagery should feel calm, considered and precise, focusing on form, proportion and material quality rather than decoration. Visuals should communicate confidence and craftsmanship without visual noise or unnecessary styling. 4.3 Rules Prioritise architecture and form over decoration. Maintain calm, balanced compositions. Let materials and geometry lead the visual story. Avoid visual noise or unnecessary styling. Use colour to define volume and structure. Limit scenes to one dominant colour plane. Balance bold hues with neutral backgrounds. Avoid decorative or scattered colour use. 4.4 Photography direction Photography should prioritise real projects wherever possible and be captured using neutral, UK true lighting. Spaces should feel authentic and well composed, highlighting clean geometry, material transitions and exact detailing. Avoid warm filters, heavy colour grading or overly staged lifestyle elements. Composition should remain minimal, allowing architecture and colour planes to define the space. Rules Use neutral or daylight balanced lighting only. Frame spaces to emphasise structure and proportion. Keep styling minimal and purposeful. Avoid lifestyle staging and decorative clutter. 5.0 Motion 5.1 Motion principles Motion within the brand should be subtle, precise and functional. Movement exists to support hierarchy, clarity and usability, never to decorate or distract. All motion should feel controlled, confident and aligned with the brand’s architectural tone. Rules Keep motion minimal and purposeful. Prioritise clarity over expression. Avoid decorative or playful movement. Ensure all motion supports usability. 5.2 UI interaction states Hover states should use soft transitions such as fades or minimal translations, typically between 100 and 150 milliseconds. Active states may introduce a slight change in colours or opacity to confirm interaction. Focus states must always include a visible focus ring to support accessibility and keyboard navigation. Rules Use short, subtle transitions only. Ensure focus states are always visible. Maintain consistency across components. Never remove accessibility cues. 5.3 Timing and easing Motion should use simple easing curves and short durations to maintain a responsive, refined feel. Avoid elastic, bouncy or playful animations that undermine the precision of the brand. Rules Keep durations between 100–150ms. Use simple ease out or linear easing. Avoid complex or expressive easing curves. 8.0 Web Kit 8.1 Hero banner Dark version The Winder&Stilhaus hero section is designed to make an immediate, elegant impact.
